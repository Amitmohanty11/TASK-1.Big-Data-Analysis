# Big Data Analysis on Airline Delays (2019)

This project uses PySpark to perform big data analysis on airline delay records for the year 2019. It integrates flight details, airport information, and weather metrics to uncover patterns in delays.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (2019 Airline Delays w/Weather and Airport Detail)
- Columns: DEP_DEL15 (delay indicator), CARRIER_NAME, DEPARTING_AIRPORT, PRCP, etc.

## 🚀 Tools Used
- PySpark
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for small visualizations)

## 📊 Key Insights
- Delay distribution by airline and airport
- Impact of weather variables on delays
- Time-of-day delay trends

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `notebook/`: Main Jupyter notebook
- `scripts/`: Optional PySpark script
- `data/`: Sample data (not full Kaggle file)

## 🔧 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
